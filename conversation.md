Pregunta:
So let me explain you what need here and first tell you that we we get a massage from all CEO or boss he say that the first task it's about extract the view model all parts from The view model to back it's a little complicated with I one that you can explain me what means this so it's important because he say that finally we can use like project Liberty so use in both side, client MAUI also client Blazer, SO THIS IS THE SCORE THAT WE NEED TO DO first I wanted you can explain me in other words what was teacher told me so in this moment we have the view models and you know we have our page and components so each one have our logic and like the file that I shared to you, so I wanted you can search in the web or documentation about this.


Respuesta:
Very good explanation! What your boss or teacher is asking for is actually a well-known architectural practice, and I'll translate it clearly for you, then give you the professional interpretation:

üéØ What they mean by "Extract ViewModels to Back"
‚úîÔ∏è Right now, your ViewModels live inside your Client, for example inside your Blazor project or MAUI project.
‚úîÔ∏è But they want you to move the ViewModels to a shared library or backend project, so:

They are NOT tightly coupled to Blazor or MAUI.

You can reuse them in multiple frontends, like Blazor WebAssembly, MAUI, even Unit Tests.
‚úîÔ∏è Sometimes this concept is called Project Liberty, or "liberating" logic from the View/UI layer.

‚úÖ Professional Translation
They want a Clean Architecture improvement:

Current Situation	What They Want
ViewModels live only inside Blazor or MAUI.	ViewModels live in a shared project, reusable.
Tightly coupled to UI frameworks.	Decoupled, UI-agnostic ViewModels.
Hard to share logic across platforms.	Shared ViewModels across MAUI, Blazor, etc.
Harder to Unit Test.	Easier to Unit Test ViewModel logic.

üõ†Ô∏è Where do we move the ViewModels?
Normally you create a Shared Project, for example:

Copiar
Editar
AppWeb.ViewModels
Or you can place them in AppWeb.Application if you follow Clean Architecture strictly, but usually ViewModels go in:

‚úîÔ∏è A Shared Class Library, referenced by both:

AppWeb.Client (Blazor WASM)

AppWeb.MAUI

Potentially by tests or other clients

‚úÖ Example Professional Structure
scss
Copiar
Editar
AppWeb.Shared
AppWeb.Domain
AppWeb.Application
AppWeb.Infrastructure
AppWeb.ViewModels  <-- NEW, portable ViewModels
AppWeb.Client       (Blazor)
AppWeb.MAUI         (Mobile)
In this case, both Blazor and MAUI reference AppWeb.ViewModels and use the same logic.

üìö Terminology for Research
You can search in web or docs with terms like:

‚úîÔ∏è "Shared ViewModels Clean Architecture"
‚úîÔ∏è "Cross-platform ViewModels Blazor MAUI"
‚úîÔ∏è "MVVM shared library .NET"
‚úîÔ∏è "Project Liberty architecture" (less formal, but your boss probably used this term)
‚úîÔ∏è "Portable Class Library ViewModel" (older term, same idea)

‚úÖ Benefits of this Approach
‚úîÔ∏è You avoid duplicate logic in each UI.
‚úîÔ∏è You maintain professional, scalable structure.
‚úîÔ∏è Unit testing becomes simpler.
‚úîÔ∏è Maintenance improves, because logic is centralized.
